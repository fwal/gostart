gostart
=======

Basic skeleton for go web apps.
I use this to kickstart my go-based web apps so I focus on building stuff instead of bootstrapping.

## Features
* Bare bone web server using Martini templates.
* Works with AppEngine as well as a standalone server.

## Go modules included
* Martini - https://github.com/codegangsta/martini
* docopt.go - https://github.com/docopt/docopt.go (Forked to https://github.com/theDukeW/docopt-go to enable go-get)

## Thoughts? Suggestions?
Feel free to drop me a line on g+, twitter (@theDukeW) or add a new issue.
